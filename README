Introduction
============

This is Pelicanfly, a plugin for
`Pelican <http://docs.getpelican.com/>`__ that lets you type things like
``i ♥ :icon-coffee:`` in your
`Markdown <http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/>`__ documents
and have it come out as little icons in the browser. It provides a
minimal extension to Markdown and a plugin for Pelican.

The Pelican plugin hacks in some static assets to make this work with
Pelican "out of the box". If you just want the Markdown extension, it is
available
`separately <http://bmcorser.github.com/markdown-fontawesome/>`__.

It's probably going to work in a better way by version 0.3.
